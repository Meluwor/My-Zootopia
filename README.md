project name: Zootopia with API

This project shall generate a website out of a dictionary which contains animals and some of their stats by using
an API. A html-template is used to give the website a basic structure 

To use this project in full you will need an own API-Key from the website: https://api-ninjas.com/ 
    API-Key:If you have one the easiest way is to create an .env file.
            Put the key in this file like: API-KEY=your-key. 
            If you don't want to create the .env file you can still
            add the key at the very start of the program via console.

            If you dont have a key at all you will just get somekind of demo.

To ensure the program to run you have to import/install the mentioned requirements of the requirements.txt.
